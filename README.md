A very Simple Botnet made in C. This project Only has a Bot-master for now but adding the Client Side Bot functionality Soon.
Instead of having a Remote Shell to the bot's machine the botnet is operated by an protocol based interaction.

### Uses
	-> Limited access to Clients machine
	-> Can only DDOS prebuild types. Not able to use a different DDOS type other than the one defined previously.

##### We need your help to improve and fix the bugs. Thank You.
