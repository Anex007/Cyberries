# Cyberries
A lightweight Botnet made in C. Safe to use on Client side, because of the lack of Remote Access to the machine.
Only works in Linux.

### Compilation
#### Bots
	cd bots/src
	make

#### Bot-Master
	cd bot-master/src
	make


### Uses
	-> Limited access to Clients machine
	-> Now only supporting
		-> Syn-Flood
		-> SlowLoris
	-> Can only DDOS prebuild types. Not able to use a different DDOS type other than the one defined previously.

##### We need your help to improve and fix the bugs. Thank You. \nHelp us add more types of DDOS scripts.
